Absolute and relative positioning are two CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)
properties used to control the positioning of elements on a web page.
They are often used in conjunction with CSS 'position' property to
determine how an elements is displayed within its containing 
element or the documnet as a whole.Here's an explanation of the key 
difference between absolute and relative positioning.

Absolute positioning: When an element is set to absolute positioning
it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, which
means an ancestor element that has a 'position' property set to 
anything other than default 'static'.if no positioned ancestor
is found, the element is positioned relative to the initial 
containing block, which is typically the viewport(the visible area of webpage).

Relative Positioning: An element with relative positioning is positioned
relative to its normal position in the document flow.it remains within
the normal document flow, but you use the 'top', 'right','bottom',
or 'left' properties to offset its position from where it would be by default.


2. Impact on document Flow:
Absolute positioning: Elements with absolute positioning are removed
from the normal document flow.This means that other elements on the page will not be aware 
of the absolute positioned elements presence and they will not be affected by
its position.

Relative Positioning: Elements with relative positioning do not affect
the positioning of other elements on the page. they still occupy
space in the document flow as if they were in their normal position,
even though they may be visually shifted using the offset properties.
('top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left')

3. Examples of Use:
Absolute Positioning: it is often used when you want to precisely
position an element relative to specific parent container or the viewport.
for example you might use absolute positioning for tooltips,
modal windows or overlay elements.

Relative Positioning: Relative Positioning is commonly used when you 
want to nudge an element from its default position without removing
it from the document flow. its useful for creating simple layouts
or adding minor adjustments to element positions.
